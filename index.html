        <p>Jorge and Poe met in previous musician jobs. They became friends and after a while they thought it would be
            an awesome idea become a <strong>Queen tribute</strong> band. They knew a lot of musicians in the Canary
            Islands, but they needed a <em>queen,</em> couse Jorge played the guitar and Poe was the drummer. <br><br>
            In that moment Juanfran appeared. Suddenly they realized they were ready. <br> As they play every night in
            different places, you can see Nestor (trumpet) when they play in the north of the island, Richard (bass)
            when they play in the east, and Gabriella (chello) when they play in the south (except second Friday of
            every month).</p>

        <h3 id="questions">Frequent questions and answers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Is it legal? <br>Yes, it is. At least as long as they let clear they are not the original <em>
                    Queen</em> band. <br> <Br></li>
            <li>I want to see them, can I make a booking? <br> Unfortunatelly that´s not possible, couse they are
                performancing in pubs and in an ice-cream shop.<br> <Br></li>
            <li>Can we give them teddy bears or flowers? <br> Despite that there are some celebrities that dont accept
                that, <em>I want it all</em> do, and they are really thankfull about it. <br> <Br></li>
            <li>Can we take pictures with them? <br> That´s up to them, if they are able to do it or not. In show
                bussiness you never know how much time you can count with. Anyway, thanks for the hype. </li>

        <h3 id="contro">Controversy</h3>
        <p>Some photos of Jorge and Poe fighting have been leaked. There´s a video of Jorge saying that he won´t get
            back to the band. Although Jorge says that he was just kidding, some fans say he was <span
                class="danger">drunk</span> that night, also he had his lips covered in blood.<br><br>Juanfran is a
            motorbiker collector. He is known in his hometown for having the record of <span class="danger">penaltee
                fee</span> for not parking in the right place. He never pays on time, not for not having the money, just
            couse that´s the only rebellious act he can have. </p>
        <p> Jorge´s other group (we are not gonna name it, but most people know about it) at first tried really hard to
            make Queen tribute tour impossible to Jorge. Making both concerts the same day. Going out to party with him
            the nigth before a Queen tribute show. But Jorge just said that this was not on purpose, and he just
            deffenden them, being always by their side.</p>
        <h3 id="datesdates">Upcoming shows</h3>
        <p>Their next tour is gonna start in 2021. <br>
            Until then, they are making shows 4 nights a week. <br> <br> </p>
